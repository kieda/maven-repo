* `kieda:collections`
  * Some estoric collections like the *k*-AVL tree and LinkedRingBuffer
  * *k*-AVL tree is really neat! We balance an AVL tree off of an arbitrary balance factor *k* rather than just `{-1, 0, 1}`. Don't think I've seen any other implementations or discussion in any other language
