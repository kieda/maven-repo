# maven-repo
Maven repository for my personal projects

## projects:
* `kieda:sealed-enum:1.0`
  * small library for using sealed classes as enums
* `kieda:quadtree:2.0`
  * quadtree implementation with generics

## to be added soon:
* `kieda:yapping:1.0`
  * **Y**et **A**nother **P**roperties **P**arser **I**n **G**java
  * Cool DSL + framework for recursive structured text parsing
  * Currently housed in ceramic-autogen
* `kieda:collections:1.0`
  * Some estoric collections like the *k*-AVL tree and LinkedRingBuffer
  * *k*-AVL tree is really neat! We balance an AVL tree off of an arbitrary balance factor *k* rather than just `{-1, 0, 1}`. Don't think I've seen any other implementations or discussion in any other language
  * Currently housed in cracking-the-coding-interview
