  * <font size="4"><b>Y</b></font>et <font size="4"><b>A</b></font>nother <font size="4"><b>P</b></font>roperties <font size="4"><b>P</b></font>arser <font size="4"><b>In</b></font> <font size="4"><b>G</b></font>java
  * Cool DSL + framework for recursive structured text parsing
  * Currently housed in ceramic-autogen
* `kieda:collections:1.0`
  * Some estoric collections like the *k*-AVL tree and LinkedRingBuffer
  * *k*-AVL tree is really neat! We balance an AVL tree off of an arbitrary balance factor *k* rather than just `{-1, 0, 1}`. Don't think I've seen any other implementations or discussion in any other language
  * Currently housed in cracking-the-coding-interview
